"""
The processing pipeline applied to every file event.

Order matters:
  1. Screenshot organize (Pictures/Videos only) — pulls screenshots out first
  2. Format conversion (HEIC->JPG, MOV->MP4)
  3. Downloads sort (by type, Downloads only)
  4. Duplicate check (content hash)
  5. Rename (Name_ext_date_time) — always last, so earlier steps see clean names
