"""
Tracks which files have already been given an AI-approved name, so a later
sweep — one where Gemini happens to be unavailable (quota, network,
missing API key, etc.) — never "downgrades" an already-nicely-named file
back into the ugly Name_ext_date convention.

Without this, utils/renamer.py's _already_renamed() check only recognizes
its OWN generated suffix format. A file that was renamed to a clean AI
name (no _ext_date suffix, by design — see renamer.rename_file) doesn't
match that pattern, so on any run where AI naming can't be reached, it
looks exactly like a brand-new, never-renamed file and gets the standard
convention slapped onto it — silently erasing every approved AI name.

Persisted as a small JSON file so it survives restarts. Best-effort: any
read/write failure just means we might re-suggest a name for a file we'd
already handled, never that we accidentally destroy user data.
